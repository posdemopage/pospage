The mock/test generator is an application that generates mock and test files of source codes.
It is modified version of the original code Google Mock generator.
For more information about Google Mock generator, visit
https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock/scripts/generator

The mock/test generator requires Python 2.3.5 or later.  If you don't have Python
installed on your system, you will also need to install it.  You can download
Python from:  http://www.python.org/download/releases/

To use the Google Mock class generator, you need to call it
on the command line passing the header file and class for which you want
to generate a Google Mock class and test file.

Make sure to install the scripts somewhere in your path.  Then you can
run the program.

  python generator.py SourceDirectory

To change the indentation from the default of 4, set INDENT in
the environment.  For example to use an indent of 2 spaces:

INDENT=2 python generator.py SourceDirectory

This version was made from tag release-1.10.0 in the googletest repository.

Known Limitations
-----------------
Not all code will be generated properly.  For example, when mocking templated
classes, the template information is lost.  You will need to add the template
information manually.

Not all permutations of using multiple pointers/references will be rendered
properly.  These will also have to be fixed manually.
