Meta storage subsystem 
: It provides a storage interface that meta filesystem can load and store individual meta pages by page-unit io

Meta storage sbusystem supports two type of storage considering test capability
1) vstore - virtual storage that all data is stored into pure system memory only.
2) pstore - persistent storage that all data is stored into non-volatile media such as nv-ram and ssd

pstore is our target for meta storage subsystem but vstore is established to allow that other modules can test their code before pstore is ready.
